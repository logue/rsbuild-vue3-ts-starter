# Vue 3 + Typescript + Rubuild Starter

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Includes [vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/) and [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) [^1].

In addition, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are also included and are set to be executed automatically at runtime and commit. (Since these settings are set strictly, please relax yourself.)

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Vue - Official](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).
